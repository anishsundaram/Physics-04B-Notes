\section*{27 Magnetic Field and Magnetic Forces}

But the \textit{fundamental} nature of magnetism is the interaction of moving 
electric charges. Unlike electric forces, which act on electric charges 
whether they are moving or not, magnetic forces act only on \textit{moving charges}.

\subsection*{27.1 Magnetism}

\begin{remark}
    The earth itself is a magnet. Its north geographic pole is close to a magnetic south pole, which is why the north pole of a compass needle points north. The earth’s magnetic axis is not quite parallel to its geographic axis (the axis of ro- tation), so a compass reading deviates somewhat from geographic north. This deviation, which varies with location, is called \textit{magnetic declination or magnetic variation.}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
     While isolated positive and negative charges exist, there is no experimental evidence that one isolated magnetic pole exists; poles always appear in pairs. If a bar magnet is broken in two, each broken end becomes a pole 
\end{remark}

\subsection*{27.2 Magnetic Field}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Summary of Electric interactions}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A distribution of electric charge creates an electric field $\vec{E}$ in the surrounding space.
        \item The electric field exerts a force $\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$ on any other charge q that is present in the field.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Summary of Magnetic interactions}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A moving charge or a current creates a \textbf{magnetic field (B)} in the surrounding
        space (in addition to its \textit{electric} field).
        \item  The magnetic field exerts a force $\vec{F}$ on any other moving charge or current that is present in the field.
    \end{enumerate}

    Magnetic Field strength can be found by the equation 
    $$B = \frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r}$$ where $\mu_0$ is the permitivity of free space($4\pi \cdot 10^{-7}$ $T\cdot m/A$) and $r$ is the seperation.

    \begin{remark}
        Like electric field, magnetic field is a vector field--that is, a vector quantity associated with each point in space. We will use the symbol $\vec{B}$ for magnetic field.
    \end{remark}
\end{definition}

\subsubsection*{27.2.1 Magnetic Forces on Moving Charges}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Key Characteristics of Magnetic Force on Moving Charges}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Force Magnitude is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.
        \item The magnitude of the force is also propor- tional to the magnitude, or “strength,” of the field.
        \item The magnetic force depends on the particle’s
        velocity.
        \item The magnetic force $\vec{F}$ does not have the same direction as the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ but instead is always perpendicular to both $\vec{B}$ and the velocity $\vec{v}$. 
    \end{enumerate}
    The Magnetic force can be found by the equation $$F = |q|v \times B = |q|vBsin\phi$$ where $\phi$ is the angle between the direction of velocity and direction of the magnetic field and the magnitude is measured in teslas ($1T = 1N/A \cdot m$) or in Gauss(1G = $10^{-4}$T)
    \begin{remark}
        The magnetic field of the earth is $10^{-4}$T 1 Gauss.
    \end{remark}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    When a charged particle moves through a region of space where both electric and magnetic fields are present, \textit{both fields exert forces on the particle}. The total force $\vec{F}$ is the vector sum of the electric and magnetic forces: $$\vec{F}=q(\vec{E} + \vec{v}\times \vec{B})$$
\end{remark}

\subsection*{27.3 Magnetic Field Lines and Magnetic Flux}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Magnetic Field Lines}:
    Just like an electric field, a magnetic field can be represented through field lines. The more lines there are in a given area the stronger the field , and they never intersect. Magnetic Field Lines are not lines of force, just direction.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Magnetic Flux($\Phi_B$)}:
    A measurement of the total magnetic field which passes through a given area. The total magnetic flux through the surface is the sum of the contributions from the individual area elements. Can be found using the following equation:
    $$\Phi_B = \int B cos\phi dA = \int\vec{B}\cdot d \vec{A}$$
    Magnetic Flux is scalar and its units are Weber(1 Wb = 1 $T\cdot m^2$ = 1 $N\cdot m/A$)

\end{definition}

\subsection*{27.4 Motion of Charged Particles in a Magnetic Field}

\begin{remark}
    Motion of a charged particle under the action of a magnetic field alone is always motion with constant speed.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    When velocity and magnetic field are perpendicular, the particle exhibits circular motion. This relation is shown by $$F = |q|vb = m\frac{v^2}{R}$$ whose radius can be found by $$R = \frac{mv}{|q|B}$$ and whose angular speed can be found by $$\omega = \frac{v}{r} = \frac{|q|B}{m}$$
\end{remark}
